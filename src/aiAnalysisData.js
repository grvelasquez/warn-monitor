    detached: "The single-family market kicks off 2026 amid continued inventory constraints. January data reflects a market still defined by **tight supply and sustained demand**, with median prices holding firm and months of supply remaining well below balanced levels. Year-over-year comparisons show the market entering 2026 on a trajectory of steady price appreciation, though the pace of gains has moderated from the rapid run-up seen in prior years. Watch for seasonal listing activity to pick up in the coming months.",
    attached: "Condos and townhomes begin 2026 with similar supply-side constraints, though **affordability pressures continue to weigh on buyer activity**. Inventory remains limited, keeping the market seller-favored. Days on market have edged higher as buyers approach purchases with more caution amid elevated rates. The attached segment remains a key entry point for first-time buyers and investors, particularly in areas with favorable rent-to-price ratios."
